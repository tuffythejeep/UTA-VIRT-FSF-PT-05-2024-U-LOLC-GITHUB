# üìö Implementing Transactions in the Library Database

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a database administrator, I want to ensure that when adding new records to the library database, all inserts are treated as a single transaction to maintain data integrity.

* As a developer, I want to utilize PostgreSQL's `DO $$ ... END $$` block to ensure that all inserts either fully complete or fully roll back, preventing any partial inserts.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a `DO $$ ... END $$` block has been added to the provided SQL script ensuring that the inserts to both the `books` and `authors` tables either complete together or fail together.

* It's done when, in the context of this block, the proper error handling mechanism has been implemented to catch any exceptions during the inserts.

* It's done when the script, upon successful execution, inserts the specified books and authors into their respective tables, and raises a notice indicating the transaction completion.

## üí° Hints

* Remember to utilize the `EXCEPTION` clause within the `DO $$ ... END $$` block in PostgreSQL to handle any errors that might occur during the transaction.

* How can you use `RAISE NOTICE` to log the outcome of the transaction, whether it's successful or encounters an error?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, challenge yourself further with the following:

* How can you extend the database schema to associate books with authors, taking into consideration that a book might have multiple authors and an author might have written multiple books?

* Implement a mechanism to capture and log more details about the specific error message that might be triggered during the transaction.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research PostgreSQL's error handling and many-to-many relationships.
