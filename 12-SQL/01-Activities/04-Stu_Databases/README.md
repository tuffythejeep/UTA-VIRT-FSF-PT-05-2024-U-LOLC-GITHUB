# 📖 Use PostgreSQL Statements to Delete, Create, and Select a Database

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to delete an existing database.

* As a developer, I want to create a new database and select that database for use.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when `sample_db` is dropped and longer appears on the list of all databases.

* It's done when a new `books_db` database is created and selected for use.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[PostgreSQL documentation on meta-commands such as executing SQL statements from a text file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)

## 💡 Hints

Which statement can we use to show all databases?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* PostgreSQL is a **relational database management system**, or **RDBMS**. What are the characteristics of an RDBMS? What other database systems fall into the category of RDBMS?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
